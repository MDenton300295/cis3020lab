	<p>1. Fallout: New Vegas: Fallout: New Vegas is by far considered the best in the series. Being the 2nd game to be in first person, the 6th in the series, it kept 
								the atmosphere and lore of the first 2 games. 
								Set in the west coast, just like the original games, New Vegas's personality is able to shine through with its design and art direction;
								along side it's amazing writing. It kep that original role-playing focus where the choices you made mattered, especially with the well written factions.
								The DLCs are also a big reason it stands out as the best for me, since each one feels completely different in setting and tone while still connecting back to the main story. 
								Together they add more depth to the world and make the overall experience feel much bigger and more complete.

	<p>2. Fallout 2: Fallout 2 is often considered one of the best in the series because it expanded on everything the first game started and gave players a much larger world to explore. 
					The story feels deep and full of choices, and your decisions can affect how different towns and groups react to you. Even though it’s older and plays very differently from the newer games, many fans love it for its strong role-playing elements and dark humor. 
					It also helped build a lot of the lore that later games like New Vegas continued to use, which is why it still stands out as one of the strongest entries in the series.							
	</p>
	<p>3. Fallout 4: Fallout 4 made major improvements to gunplay and weapon customization, making combat feel smoother and more modern than any previous entry. 
					It was also the first game in the series to use a fully voiced protagonist, which was an interesting idea but ended up limiting dialogue choices and hurting the role-playing feel. 
					The main story and conversations felt weaker because of this, but the DLCs helped make up for it. Far Harbor especially stood out, with a deeper story that many players felt was even better than the base game’s main plot. 	
	</p>
	<p>4. Fallout (Tv Show): The Fallout TV show does a great job capturing the look and feel of modern Fallout, making it a strong entry point for people who are new to the universe.
							 It brings the world to life in a way that feels familiar to fans of the newer games, as the tone has shifted  from the original ideas of the series. 
							 With season 2 just finishing, the show is still well written and enjoyable nonetheless, and Cooper Howard/ The Ghoul really stands out as the star of the series.
	</p>
	<p>5. Fallout 3: Fallout 3 was the first game to move the series from its original isometric style into a full first-person world, and it handled that transition really well for its time. It was also Bethesda’s first Fallout and the first to take place on the East Coast. 
					While it started the shift away from the original tone and lore, it was still a strong entry that helped bring the series to a much wider audience.
